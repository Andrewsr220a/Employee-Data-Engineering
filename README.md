## Data engineering:
In this project I imported several CSV files into a SQL database, using pgAdmin 4.

I modeled the data using and ERD of tables using the quick data base platform

- List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

In the the "Employee Info" folder you will find:
